# Developer take home test (Node)
This is a small repo designed as a take home test for Equiem developer applicants.

## What to do
1. Clone this repository locally so that you can start working on the test.
2. Make sure you create a separate branch (call it your name in lower case prefixed with `candidate`) eg. `candidate-jeremy-kirkham`
3. For each assigned test, change directory into that folder (eg. `cd fizz-buzz`). Each test directory will have a separate readme with more detailed instructions.
4. Install the repo dependencies `npm install`
5. Run the tests `npm test` - these will all be failing to begin with, it's up to you to get them to pass!
6. Once you're happy with your solution, push up your branch to Github, and open a Pull Request. We'll then go through your answers in a follow up session.
